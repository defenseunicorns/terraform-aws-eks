# AWS EKS Module

This repository contains Terraform configuration files that create an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. This module sets various paremeters for this cluster including the cluster name, version, VPC information, security group rules, and user and role mappings. Additionally, it sets up self-managed node groups for the EKS cluster.

## Examples
